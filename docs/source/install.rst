Installation
============

Compatibility and design
------------------------

``lasio`` is written to be compatible with Python 2.6+ (and runs without modification on Python 3).

It is structured as a standard Python package so that you can use it without having to modify your PYTHONPATH environment variable or update versions by copying files manually.

Installation from PyPI
----------------------

The recommended way to install it is from `PyPI <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/lasio>`__ with:

.. code:: bash

    $ pip install lasio

If necessary this will download and install the packages which ``lasio`` depends on to run:

- `ordereddict <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/ordereddict>`__ - simple extension to the standard library for Python 2.6 support
- `numpy <http://numpy.org>`__ - for numerical computing, often pre-installed with scientific Python distributions

There are some packages which ``lasio`` will use to provide extra functionality if they are installed, but they are not required:

- `pandas <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pandas>`__ - data analysis library
- `chardet <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/chardet>`__ or `cChardet <https://github.com/PyYoshi/cChardet>`__ - automatic detection of character encodings

Unless you have a particular reason I'd recommend installing these as well with:

.. code:: bash

    $ pip install -r optional-packages.txt

Updating your installation from PyPI
------------------------------------

New releases are frequently sent to `PyPI <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/lasio>`__, so if you want to stay updated:

.. code:: bash

   $ pip install --upgrade lasio

Installing from git
-------------------

If you would like the latest version from `GitHub <https://github.com/kinverarity1/lasio>`__ use:

.. code:: bash

    $ git clone https://github.com/kinverarity1/lasio.git
    $ cd lasio
    $ python setup.py develop

And to update:

.. code:: bash

    $ git pull origin master
